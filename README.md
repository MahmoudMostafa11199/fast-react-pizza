# üçï Fast React Pizza Co.

### Description

A simple application that allows you to order one or more pizzas from a changing menu, without the need for account creation or login. Add pizzas to your cart, then enter your name, phone number, and address, with the option to add GPS location. You can also mark your order as 'priority' for an additional fee. Payment is made upon delivery, and each order receives a unique ID for tracking. You can also change your order to 'priority' even after it has been placed.
